Atk4-joomla

Currently this is not installable project just a porting of atk4 to work with joomla. Once the required changes are mature in the project, this project will be updated to a Joomla Component Development Component.


INSTALL
TO Use Atk4 for joomla you need to follow the following steps:

NOTE: Remember This will not create any Menu in admin side or it will not be a installable component RIGHT NOW (but it will be soon) So you need to work yourself a bit now .. working on joomla 2.5.

Step1: Create a folder in JOOMLA/components or JOOMLA/administrator/components named com_{YourComponentName}
Step2: Setup your ATK4 as you do in this folder
Step3: Put atk4-joomla in the same folder
Step3: from this atk4-joomla/example folder move yourcomponent.php and index.php files out in your component root 
Step4: Rename yourcomponent.php file with your component name, must be same as the one in foldername.
